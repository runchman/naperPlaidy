Some notes on this code:

* This repo does not have the correct folder structure. Don't expect to be able to clone and make it go.
* For simplicity I hard-coded it to 5 businesses and 5 autocomplete suggestions only.
* I'm obviously not a graphics designer!!! I presume you have people actually good at that. I am not one of those people.
* I didn't put my server file on here because it has things for my SimplServe app that I don't want public. I'll be glad to review that in person.
* That's It!
